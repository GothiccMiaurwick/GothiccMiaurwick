💻 Self-taught Front-End Developer  
🎯 Passionate about building interfaces that not only work, but feel good  
🌙 Night owl, coffee lover, and fan of aesthetic code & cozy projects  

### 📚 Learning Journey
I'm currently studying on my own through platforms like Udemy and any corner of the internet that helps me grow 🌐.  
Self-learning has taught me more than just code — it’s given me discipline, curiosity, and a huge drive to keep improving.

### 🌱 Right now I'm:
- Diving deeper into responsive design & CSS animations
- Building personal projects to grow my portfolio
- Slowly exploring frameworks like React

### 🧠 My mindset
I love crafting things with intention — interfaces that tell a story and make users feel something.  
Every line of code is part of the bigger picture.
